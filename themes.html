                <h2>What Are Some Key Themes In Parks and Recreation?</h2>
                <p>We're delving into the core themes seen throughout the seven seasons of the hit mockumentary comedy series Parks and Recreation.</p>
                <h3>Political Commentary</h3> 
                <p>
                    While Parks and Rec has never been assertively political and has generally avoided real-world, hot-button issues, there is still political commentary in its own way.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parks and Rec shows that we need the government to do things that the private sector can't or won't, like preserving public spaces.</li>
                    <li>The show also illustrates the perspective that while some civil servants may be bumbling (like poor Jerry), they can also be well-intentioned and competetent.</li>
                    <li>Although deemed liberal, the show gives an unbiased look at several differing viewpoints on the role of government. For example, Ron Swanson identifies as a libertarian and believes the government to be unnecessary in general. Leslie Knope on the other hand believes fully in the power of the government and shows some idolization of more liberal-leaning political figures such as Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Social Commentary</h3>
                <p>
                    The biggest social commentary in Parks and Rec focuses on the importance of community and the idea that people need each other. It goes further in showcasing several instances of when a character helps someone, they are also helping to make themselves better.
                </p>
                <h3>Friendship</h3>
                 <p>
                    Throughout the show, there are numerous instances of the power of friendship benefitting the characters. Friendship was showed to transcend even the toughest hurdles time and time again throughout the series. From Leslie and Ron's deep friendship to the friendship of Tom and Donna, this theme is present throughout every episode of the series. The jokes that are made within and about the various friendships show the caring and lovable natures of the characters and often poke fun at the cheesiness of many of the key friendship moments. 
                 </p>
                <h3>Ridiculousness</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most common themes among the jokes and some of the plotlines is that of ridiculousness. These instances tend to have no presence in furthering character development or serious plot points, but rather serve as pure comic relief. 
                </p>
                <h3>Vices</h3>
                <p>
                    The role of vices in Parks and Rec is evident throughout the series, with nearly every character having moments of where their vices show through. From Tom and Donna's materialism to Leslie's obsessive, workaholic tendencies, for the most part these vices are met with lessons learned. For example, when Leslie gets stuck on a project or is working hard to achieve something, she expects and even attempts to demand that those around her do exactly what she asks. While her intentions are almost always admirable, she takes advantage of her friends' good will and often ends up having a moment of realization that what she is asking is unreasonable and she should respect her friends' boundaries.
