        <h1>Cast and Characters </h1>
        <p class="cast__p">The primary characters of the American television comedy series Parks and Recreation are the
            employees of the parks department of Pawnee, a fictional Indiana town. The protagonist is Leslie Knope (Amy
            Poehler), the deputy parks director as well as serving on city council, and the rest of the ensemble cast
            consists of her friends and co-workers, including nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), parks director Ron
            Swanson (Nick Offerman), and parks department employees Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), April Ludgate (Aubrey
            Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), and Donna Meagle (Retta).</p>

        <p class="cast__ptwo"> While most of the main cast have been with the series since it debuted in April 2009,
            actors
            Rob Lowe and Adam Scott joined the cast late in the second season portraying Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt,
            two state auditors who later take permanent jobs in Pawnee. Paul Schneider was a regular cast member during
            the first two seasons as city planner Mark Brendanawicz, but he departed at the end of season two. Billy
            Eichner who portrays Craig Middlebrooks, the "associate administrator" of the Pawnee parks department,
            recurred throughout the show's sixth season until he was promoted to the main cast in the fourth episode of
            the seventh season. The majority of Parks and Recreation episodes are set in Pawnee, and most of the
            recurring and supporting characters are friends of the main characters or residents of the town.
