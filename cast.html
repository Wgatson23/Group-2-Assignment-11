                <h2>Cast and Characters</h2>
                <p>The primary characters of the American television comedy series Parks and Recreation are the
                    employees of the parks department of Pawnee, a fictional Indiana town. The protagonist is Leslie
                    Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy parks director as well as serving on city council, and the rest of
                    the ensemble cast consists of her friends and co-workers, including nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida
                    Jones),</p>
                <p>While most of the main cast have been with the series since it debuted in April 2009, actors Rob Lowe
                    and Adam Scott joined the cast late in the second season portraying Chris Traeger and Ben Wyatt, two
                    state auditors who later take permanent jobs in Pawnee. Paul Schneider was a regular cast member
                    during the first two seasons as city planner Mark Brendanawicz, but he departed at the end of season
                    two. Billy Eichner who portrays Craig Middlebrooks, the "associate administrator" of the Pawnee
                    parks department, recurred throughout the show's sixth season until he was promoted to the main cast
                    in the fourth episode of the seventh season.</p>
